# ToDoDoLi
## What is it?
[ToDoDoLi](https://tododoli.github.io/) is completely free cloud-based To-Do List web-app.

It's far enough from being cool, but I'd be happy if found it useful.
## What is it for?
For me the app is just a project to learn and practice using React JS.

For you it might be a fast and simple tool to create, manage and share different kind of lists.
## What can I do with it?

- **Create** list with **specified title and color**
- **Rename** list
- **Copy link** to list in just **one tap** to share it 
- **Add, edit and delete** list items
- **Mark** and unmark items as **done**
- Store **links** in items
- Add lists to local **pinned** 
- Access local **recent** lists

## Will it become better?
I hope it will. I'm planning to add more cool features.

## Can I contribute?
I'm going to show the project to my future employer, so I prefer it to be written by my own.

## I've found an issue
Feel free to report about it!
